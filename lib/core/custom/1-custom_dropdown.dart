/// The one placeholder colour every dropdown in the app uses.
///
/// ADDED 19/8/2026 — the hint colour used to be whatever a caller happened to
/// pass in `hintStyle`, and the three dropdowns disagreed about the default:
/// `AppColors.text.withOpacity(0.4)` here and on the range calendar, plain
/// `AppColors.secondaryText` on the date calendar. Two of those sitting on one
/// row showed two different greys.
///
/// It is NOT a parameter any more. `hintStyle` still owns size, weight and
/// family — the colour is reapplied on top of whatever the caller passes, so
/// `hintStyle: ....copyWith(color: Colors.red)` is silently ignored rather
/// than allowed to drift. Both calendar dropdowns import this rather than
/// keeping a copy, which is what let them drift in the first place.
///
/// A getter, not a `const`: `AppColors.secondaryText` resolves against the
/// active theme, so this has to be read at build time.
///
/// CHANGED 16/9/2026 — full `AppColors.secondaryText` (was 50% opacity), per
/// design review on the GRC dashboard. Still the one colour for every hint.
Color get kDropdownHintColor => AppColors.secondaryText;

/// The fill behind a dropdown TRIGGER, and the colour of its chevron.
///
/// ADDED 12/9/2026. Controls that are not dropdowns but have to READ as one —
/// the publish-date From/To fields in the Knowledge Hub filter dialog sit
/// directly under three of these — used to hardcode their own copies of both
/// values, and drifted: the date field drew its calendar glyph at full
/// `AppColors.secondaryText` while the chevron beside it was half-opacity, so
/// two fields in the same column showed two different icon weights.
///
/// Getters, not `const`: the AppColors entries resolve against the active
/// theme, so both have to be read at build time.
Color get kDropdownFillColor => AppColors.background;

/// The chevron dims while the field is empty and takes its normal colour once
/// something is chosen, so an unanswered field reads as unanswered at a glance
/// rather than only by its hint text. [hasValue] is the same "something is
/// selected" test that drives the trigger's `isEmpty` and `hintText`.
// CHANGED 30/9/2026 (Role QA p.6): at 50% opacity the chevron (and the
// calendar icon, which follows this colour) almost disappeared on the grey
// field fill. Both states are now the full secondary-text grey.

/// `CustomDropdownCalendar` used 6, and screens that hand-roll a labelled box
/// (Adding New Access) used 8. Since the gap sits ABOVE the field, a different
/// gap means the FIELDS start at different heights: a row of three read as

/// fixed it.
///

    // way to make a dropdown match a 36pt row of controls, and what several

    // `height:` is the parameter that means "size the trigger" (see `_sized`),
    // and call sites should prefer it. But a widget should not paint a red

    // bounded, hand the label and helper their natural height and let the
    // trigger absorb the remainder, exactly as `height:` would have.
    // Unbounded parents keep the previous behaviour byte for byte.
    // `Flexible(fit: loose)` and not `Expanded`: loose means the trigger keeps
    // its natural height whenever there is room for it, and only gives ground
    // when there is not. `Expanded` would force it to fill, so a dropdown
    // sitting in a tall Row (bounded, but with height to spare) would stretch
    // to the full row — a regression the striped overflow would have hidden.
    //
