/// File Name: custom_dropdown_calendar.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `CustomDropdownCalendar`.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Updated: 11/8/2026 - Added the standard module + FILE INFO header.
/// Updated: 30/8/2026 - The picker opens at `DatePicker`'s size (520×380 on
///          tablet, 360×380 on phone) instead of a 320 square, so the app's two
///          calendars are the same dialog.
/// Updated: 30/8/2026 - The picker's two action buttons are `customButton`s,
///          one pinned to each edge of the dialog, and the month arrows are the
///          app's own `chevron_left` / `chevron_right` assets. `Get.locale` is
///          gone with them — text direction now comes from `Directionality`.

/// ADDED 30/8/2026, all RAW (the ScreenUtil suffix is applied at each point of
/// use — and note WHICH suffix: the tablet numbers are `.sp`, the phone ones
/// `.w` / `.h`, matching `DatePicker` below).
///
/// REVISED 30/8/2026: these were a single 320 square. `DatePicker`
/// (core/custom/53-custom_date_pic) — the app's other calendar, the one the
/// Knowledge Hub schedule fields open — is 520 × 380 on tablet and 360 × 380 on
/// phone, so the same seven columns had appreciably more room there and the two
/// pickers read as two different components. The numbers below are that
/// widget's, so the two now open at the same size.
///
/// The action buttons are measured FROM the dialog width, which is the only way
/// to get one button against each edge: `calendar_date_picker2` lays its
/// actions out as `Row(mainAxisAlignment: end, children: [cancel, ok])` with no
/// alignment or spacer of its own, so two content-sized buttons always huddle
/// on the trailing side. Give each one a slot of exactly half the dialog and
/// the row is full — the leftover space that would have pushed them together is
/// now inside the slots, and each button sits at its own outer edge.
///
/// The two slots must therefore add up to the dialog width EXACTLY: short, and
/// the pair drifts back toward the trailing edge; long, and the Row overflows.
/// That is why both come from [_pickerDialogSize] rather than from two
/// constants that could drift apart.
const double _kPickerDialogWidthTablet = 520;

/// REVISED: was 360, which is wider than a dialog can actually be on a phone.
/// `Dialog` reserves `insetPadding` (40 a side) plus the safe area, so on a
/// 402pt-wide handset the widest a dialog gets is ~322 — but the action-button
/// slots were still measured from the 360 that was ASKED for, so the two slots
/// added up to more than the row had and the trailing button overflowed. The
/// number is smaller now AND clamped to what is available in
/// [_pickerDialogSize]; do not raise it past what the narrowest supported
/// phone can show.

/// It used to be a flat 380 scaled by `.sp` / `.h`, which the package then
/// FLOORED at 410 logical pixels (`max(dialogSize.height, 410)` in
/// `showCalendarDatePicker2Dialog`) — so on a phone the number asked for was
/// inert and the dialog was always exactly as tall as the content needed, with
/// nothing to spare. That is why [buttonPadding] at the call below had to be
/// zero on the vertical axis.
///
/// The action row now carries [_kPickerButtonMargin] above and below it, to
/// match the margin it already has on the left and right, so the height is
/// built from its parts instead. Note WHICH parts scale: the calendar's own
/// height is raw logical pixels straight out of the package, while the button
/// and its margins are `.sp` — a single scaled constant would shrink below the
/// 410 floor on a small phone and clip the row again.
