/// File Name: 38-custom_responsive.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `ResponsiveHelper`, `ScreenSize`, and the width-based
///          breakpoint helpers every responsive screen should key off.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Updated: 11/8/2026 - Added the standard module + FILE INFO header.
/// Updated: 12/9/2026 - Added the three-way mobile / tablet / desktop
///                      breakpoints (`ScreenSize`, `screenSizeOf`,
///                      `responsiveValue`) and an optional `desktopWidget`
///                      on ResponsiveHelper, so screens designed at 375 /
///                      768 / 1024 in Figma can render their own layout at
///                      each size instead of collapsing into one "tablet"
///                      branch.

/// shortestSide (768) in both orientations, so `shortestSide` cannot tell the
/// 768-wide portrait design from the 1024-wide landscape one — the very
