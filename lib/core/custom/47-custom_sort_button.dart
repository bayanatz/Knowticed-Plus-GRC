/// Module: Core · Custom · Sort Button
/// Description: Reusable generic sort button with dropdown, extracted from
///              SortDropdownWidgetRole (account_status/search_and_filter).
///              When an item is selected the WHOLE container turns
///              AppColors.primary and the svg + text turn
///              AppColors.textButton. The selected menu item is highlighted
///              with a primary background as well.
/// Author: Knowticed Team
/// Date: 06/07/2026
/// Dependencies: CustomDropdown (1-custom_dropdown.dart), flutter_screenutil,
///               AppColors, StyleText, ButtonSizing, CustomSvgImage.
///
/// Revision History:
///   16/8/2026 — the trigger now keeps its own label ("Sort") after a selection
///   instead of being overwritten by the selected option; text comes from
///   `StyleText`; the icon is an explicit 20.sp and the prefix/suffix paddings
///   are tightened, so the button matches the height and rhythm of the Filter
///   button beside it.
///   16/8/2026 — icon and label are CENTRED as one pair rather than starting at
///   the leading edge, and the label is 12.sp. Both come from the trigger no
///   longer using InputDecorator's hint, which is start-anchored and sized to
///   whatever the prefix icon leaves; the pair is now a single centred Row in
///   the prefix slot, the same shape `CustomFilterIcon` uses. NOTHING about the
///   button's size changed with it — same `SizedBox`, same trigger padding.
///   16/8/2026 — the dead space on the RIGHT of the label is gone. Two things
///   were holding it open, and both had to go: `InputDecorator` applies
///   `contentPadding` to the INPUT area, which sits AFTER the prefix — so the
///   trigger's 8+8 horizontal padding was 16pt of empty input, not padding
///   around the button's content — and the suffix slot was still being built
///   even though a zero-width box was passed to it. The trigger's horizontal
///   padding is now 0 (the 8pt gutter moved INSIDE the prefix, where it
///   belongs) and `CustomDropdown.showSuffixIcon: false` drops the suffix
///   entirely, so the icon+label pair is centred in the WHOLE button.
///   12/9/2026 — the default size now follows [ButtonSizing]: 38.sp square
///   on phone, 135.sp x 38.sp otherwise (was a flat 70.sp wide at every
///   size, so it never lined up with the buttons next to it). An explicit
///   `width` / `height` still wins, so existing call sites are unchanged.
