/// File Name: circle_progress_master.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `CircleProgressMaster` and the app's modal loading
///          overlay — the ONE home for "something is in progress".
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Updated: 11/8/2026 - Added the standard module + FILE INFO header.
/// Updated: 10/9/2026 - Absorbed `83-loading.dart`, which is deleted.
///
/// WHY THERE IS ONLY ONE OF THESE NOW
/// `83-loading.dart` held a second spinner widget, `CircleProgress`, and the
/// two `showLoadingIndicator` / `hideLoadingIndicator` helpers. The two widgets
/// were the same control drawn differently — `CircleProgress` in
/// `secondaryPrimary` at whatever size its parent happened to give it,
/// `CircleProgressMaster` in `lightPrimary` at a fixed fraction of the screen —
/// so which spinner a screen showed came down to which file its author had
/// imported. Every `CircleProgress` is a `CircleProgressMaster` now.
///
/// The two overlay helpers moved here UNCHANGED. They are not built on
/// `CircleProgressMaster`: the modal draws a deliberately larger 70pt ring, and
/// rebuilding it on the inline widget would have silently shrunk every loading
/// dialog in the app.
