/// File Name: 89-custom_empty_state.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `CustomEmptyState`.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 16/8/2026
///
/// The app's ONE empty state: the `lottie_empty` animation, no words.
///
/// WHY NO TEXT
/// -----------
/// Every list, table and filter result used to write its own sentence — "No
/// employees found", "Nobody has access yet", "No tables match", "No databases
/// yet". Four screens, four wordings, four translations, and all of them
/// saying the same thing the empty space already said. The animation carries
/// it, so the sentences went with it on 16/8/2026.
///
/// This deliberately takes NO label parameter. An optional one would grow
/// back into the same pile of near-identical strings within a week, and a
/// caller that genuinely needs to explain something — a FAILED read, which is
/// not the same as an empty one — should say so in its own widget rather than
/// dressing an error up as emptiness.
///
/// EMPTY IS NOT AN ERROR
/// ---------------------
/// Do not reach for this when a read FAILED. "There is nothing here" and "we
/// could not find out what is here" are different facts, and the screens that
/// tell them apart (the Database Builder list, the access table) keep their
/// own error branch with its retry. Showing this animation over a denied read
/// is the one message a user cannot argue with and cannot fix.
