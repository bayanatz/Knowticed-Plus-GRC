/// File Name: responsive_card_grid.dart
/// Purpose: Reusable, overflow-proof sizing for card grids.
/// Author: Amr Mesbah
/// Created At: 03/08/2026
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
/// ---------------
/// GridView needs a fixed cell height (`mainAxisExtent`), but card content
/// grows with fonts, locale and the user's text-scale setting. Hard-coding a
/// per-breakpoint height means it either overflows on one device or leaves
/// dead space on another.
///
/// The fix is two independent pieces — use them together:
///
///   1. [ResponsiveCardHeight] — computes the cell height from what the card's
///      content actually needs (its text line sizes, gaps and padding), NOT
///      from the cell width. A card stays the same compact size on a phone and
///      on a wide desktop; it only grows when the fonts themselves grow.
///
///   2. [ResponsiveCardContent] — wraps the card's text block so it scales
///      itself down if the cell ever turns out shorter than the content needs.
///      This is the safety net that makes overflow structurally impossible.
///
/// IS THE HEIGHT DATA-DEPENDENT?
/// -----------------------------
/// No. It depends on the card's *shape* — how many text rows it has and at
/// what font sizes — which is identical for every record in the grid. Per-record
/// data (a longer title, a missing date) is absorbed by `maxLines` + ellipsis
/// inside the card, and by [ResponsiveCardContent] as a last resort. So you
/// configure it once per card type, not per item.

  /// [gapSizes]       vertical gaps between those rows, e.g. `[6.sp, 6.sp]`
  /// [verticalPadding] total top + bottom padding of the card
