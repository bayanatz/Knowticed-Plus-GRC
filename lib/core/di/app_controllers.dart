// Description: Single dependency-injection seam over the GetX service locator
//              for the app-wide controllers the services module depends on.
//              Centralising `Get.find<...>()` here means the eventual GetX
//              removal is a one-file change instead of touching ~160 call
//              sites. Call sites use `AppControllers.employee` /
//              `AppControllers.employee` and never reference GetX directly.
