/// File Name: app_locale.dart
/// Purpose: The single place that decides, stores and applies the app language.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created: 01/09/2026
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
///
/// The language used to be decided in three places that could disagree:
///
///   1. `main()` read GetStorage['LocaleData'] and called `S.load(Locale('ar'))`
///      — language only, no country.
///   2. `MyApp.build` read the SAME key and built `Locale('ar', 'EG')`.
///   3. `LanguageScreen.toggleLangSwitch` wrote that key and called
///      `Get.updateLocale(Locale('ar', 'SA'))` — a THIRD country code.
///
/// plus `ThemeAndLocalizationsCubit`, which read a completely different store
/// (SharedPreferences['appLocale']) that nothing ever wrote.
///
/// `S` resolves on languageCode alone, so the messages survived that. Anything
/// keyed on the FULL tag did not: `S.load` sets `Intl.defaultLocale` to
/// `locale.toString()`, so booting into Arabic left `Intl.defaultLocale` as
/// `ar_EG` while switching to Arabic at runtime left it as `ar_SA`. Every
/// DateFormat and NumberFormat that relies on the ambient locale therefore
/// formatted differently depending on HOW the app arrived in Arabic.
///
/// Everything that sets or reads the language now goes through here.
