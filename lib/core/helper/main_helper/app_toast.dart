/// File Name: app_toast.dart
/// Purpose: Platform-safe wrapper around Fluttertoast.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 2/9/2026
///
/// `fluttertoast` ships Android, iOS and Web only — it has **no macOS,
/// Windows or Linux implementation**, which you can confirm in
/// `macos/Flutter/GeneratedPluginRegistrant.swift`: it is not registered there.
/// Calling `Fluttertoast.showToast` on desktop therefore throws
///
///     MissingPluginException(No implementation found for method showToast on
///     channel PonnamKarthik/fluttertoast)
///
/// as an uncaught async error. That is bad anywhere, and actively harmful in an
/// error handler: the toast reporting a failure blows up and hides the failure
/// it was reporting. That is exactly what happened with the chat recorder.
///
/// Use [AppToast.show] instead of `Fluttertoast.showToast` everywhere. On the
/// supported platforms it is the same toast; on desktop it logs instead of
/// throwing.
