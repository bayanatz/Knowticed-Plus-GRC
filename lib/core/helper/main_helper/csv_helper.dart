/// File Name: csv_helper.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `CSVHelper`.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Updated: 11/8/2026 - Added the standard module + FILE INFO header.
/// Updated: 10/9/2026 - Added [exportForUser] / [exportRowsForUser], the
///                      PHONE-SAFE save path. [exportToCSV] below writes
///                      straight to a folder, which does not reach the user on
///                      a phone at all — see the doc on [exportForUser].
/// Updated: 30/8/2026 - The save location moved to [ExportDirectory.resolve].
///                      This file used to send macOS and iOS to
///                      `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`, which under the
///                      app sandbox is the container's Documents folder — not
///                      `~/Documents` — so on macOS every CSV was written
///                      somewhere the user never sees. See export_directory.dart
///                      for the full account.

  /// ADDED 10/9/2026, lifted verbatim from `RoleCubit.exportRolesToCsv` — which
  /// now calls this — so the app has ONE answer to "save this file for the
  /// user" instead of one per feature. The roles export had already been
  /// reported broken twice and fixed twice; the phone export flows were still
  /// running the pre-fix code through [exportToCSV] and were broken in exactly
  /// the ways its history describes:
  ///
  /// - Android: [ExportDirectory.resolve] writes straight into
  ///   `/storage/emulated/0/Download`. Scoped storage (API 29+) forbids that,
  ///   so `File.writeAsBytes` throws `Permission denied` and nothing is saved.
  /// - iOS: the write SUCCEEDS, into the app's private Documents folder. There
  ///   is no user-visible Downloads on iOS and this app does not publish its
  ///   Documents folder to the Files app, so the file exists and cannot be
  ///   reached from anywhere. This is the "export does not work" that has no
  ///   error to show for itself.
  ///
  /// Both phone platforms therefore stage the CSV in the temp folder and hand
  /// it to the system save sheet through `flutter_file_dialog` — SAF on
  /// Android, "Save to Files" on iOS — the one path that needs no storage
  /// permission on any Android version. The user picks the destination, so
  /// there is no "where did it go" left to answer. Desktop keeps the real
  /// Downloads folder.
  ///
  /// The UTF-8 BOM is not optional: this app's exports carry Arabic, and Excel
  /// reads a BOM-less UTF-8 CSV as the local codepage — the Arabic columns
  /// open as mojibake.
  ///
  /// Returns Left = an error message; Right = the saved path, or
  /// [exportCancelled] when the user dismissed the save sheet — nothing was
  /// written and nothing went wrong, so the caller shows neither outcome.
  ///
  /// CHANGED 28/9/2026 (Knowledge Hub bug report p.24 — "when press export
  /// only export the file and show confirmation message"): the desktop path no
  /// longer opens the Downloads folder in the file manager after writing. The
  /// caller shows its confirmation dialog instead. Pass [revealFolder] `true`
  /// to get the old behaviour back for one call site.
