/// File Name: device_policy_controller.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `DevicePolicyController` — the on/off state behind the
///          Take Screen Shot, Restricted Location and Screen Share settings.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 23/8/2026
/// Updated: 26/8/2026 - Take Screen Shot and Screen Share are no longer
///          state-only. Both now feed [ScreenCaptureGuard], which applies
///          FLAG_SECURE (Android), WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE (Windows), the
///          secure-layer trick (iOS) and NSWindow.sharingType = .none
///          (macOS).
///
/// These three sit in `SettingsPermissions` alongside Branding, Company
/// Information, Animation and Biometrics, but unlike those they are not a
/// "hide this menu entry" flag — they describe a device behaviour. The role
/// permission decides whether the employee is ALLOWED to see and change the
/// setting; this controller holds what they chose.
///
/// Storage mirrors [BiometricController]: a GetStorage-backed RxBool per
/// toggle, defaulting to on when nothing has been written yet.
///
/// WHAT SCREEN SHARE MEANS HERE: whether another app on the device — Zoom,
/// Teams, Meet, QuickTime, OBS — may show this app's window to a meeting.
/// It is not a share feature inside Knowticed Plus.
///
/// THE TWO CAPTURE SWITCHES SHARE ONE OS LEVER. Every platform blocks
/// screenshots, screen recording and meeting shares with the same call, so
/// [ScreenCaptureGuard] blocks as soon as EITHER switch is off — turning
/// Screen Share off also stops screenshots, and vice versa. See the header of
/// screen_capture_guard.dart before trying to separate them.
///
/// RESTRICTED LOCATION stores its allow-list here ([allowedCountryCodes],
/// picked in `RestrictedLocationCountries` under the switch) but is STILL NOT
/// ENFORCED: nothing yet reads the list and refuses to open the app outside
/// it. That geofence check has to be written against this flag the same way
/// [applyScreenCapturePolicy] was for the other two.
