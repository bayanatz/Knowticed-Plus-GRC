/// File Name: localized_number.dart
/// Purpose: Render a number using the active locale's numerals.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 13/8/2026
///
/// Added because every count chip in the app rendered `count.toString()`, which
/// is always ASCII — so an Arabic screen showed "14" and "٠" side by side with
/// Arabic-Indic dates like "١٣ أغسطس ٢٠٢٦".
///
/// `LocalizedDigits` in `features/settings/se1_profile/data/utils` already does
/// this for strings, but `core/` must not import from `features/` — hence this
/// core-level twin. Both wrap `NumberFormat`, whose digit symbols are compiled
/// into intl, so unlike `DateFormat` this needs no async initialization.
///
/// ⚠️ Display only. Never use this on a value that will be stored, parsed or
/// compared — Arabic-Indic digits will not round-trip through `int.parse` or a
/// Firestore query.

  /// FIXED 22/8/2026 — Arabic fields were still counting in Latin digits
  /// ("158 / 500" under Arabic body text). `NumberFormat.decimalPattern('ar')`
  /// is supposed to carry ZERO_DIGIT `٠`, but which numbering system CLDR
  /// hands a bare `ar` has moved between intl releases, and an unrecognised
  /// locale silently falls back to `en` rather than throwing — so the call was
  /// only ever *probably* Arabic-Indic, with no way to tell from the call site.

  /// The digits are now mapped here for any `ar…` locale tag, which cannot
  /// depend on the intl version. `NumberFormat` still does the formatting, so

  /// ADDED 2/9/2026. [of] only covers a bare `num`, so anything pre-formatted
  /// by `DateFormat` (every date and time label in the chat lists) still came
  /// out in Latin digits next to Arabic-Indic counts. `DateFormat`'s own
  /// locale digits cannot be relied on here for the same reason spelled out
  /// below for `NumberFormat`: which numbering system CLDR hands a bare `ar`
  /// has moved between intl releases, and an unknown locale falls back to `en`
