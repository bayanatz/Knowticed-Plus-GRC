/// File Name: company_modules.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `CompanyModules` — "is this module part of what the
///          COMPANY bought?", as opposed to "does this employee's role reach
///          it?".
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 30/8/2026
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
/// ---------------
/// There are two separate module gates in this app and they answer different
/// questions:
///
///   * the ROLE layer — `AppControllers.employee.hasModuleAccess(module)` and
///     the `isHasPermission` family. "Is this employee allowed in?" Per person.
///   * the LICENCE layer — the company's `Demo_Requests/{companyId}.Modules`
///     map, read by `AppDrawerRepository.getCompanyLicensedModules` and held by
///     [AppDrawerCubit]. "Did this company buy it at all?" Per company.
///
/// Until now the licence layer had no public read-out. `AppDrawerCubit` kept it
/// private and exposed only `allowedDrawerModules`, which is already
/// role ∩ licence — so a screen asking "does this company have HR?" would have
/// got "no" for a company that owns HR whenever the CURRENT USER's role happens
/// not to include it. That is the wrong answer for a question about the
/// company. This class asks the licence layer directly.
///
/// ⚠️ FAIL-OPEN, deliberately, and the opposite of the drawer's own default.
/// The drawer fails CLOSED — no licence data means show no modules — because
/// there the cost of being wrong is showing a module the company never bought.
/// Here the callers are the reverse shape: they HIDE existing UI when a module
/// is present, so "unknown" must mean "do not hide" or a slow Firestore read
/// would make working screens vanish. [isActive] therefore returns false
/// whenever it cannot answer, and every caller should be written so that false
/// leaves the screen as it was.
