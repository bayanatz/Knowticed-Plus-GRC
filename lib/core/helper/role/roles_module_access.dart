/// File Name: roles_module_access.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `RolesModuleAccess` — the permission gate for the Roles
///          module's four sections.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 25/8/2026
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
/// ---------------
/// Reported: "switches of user access and active directory not work". They did
/// not, because nothing read them. `UserAccess` and `ActiveDirectory` (in
/// `r1_role_management/domain/enums/roles/`) declare twelve permissions between
/// them, the role editor writes all twelve to Firebase, and neither the User
/// Access page nor the Active Directory table ever asked about a single one —
/// every button was unconditional. Toggling a switch changed a stored value
/// that no screen consulted.
///
/// THE SECTION SWITCH IS A SEPARATE VALUE
/// -------------------------------------
/// The role editor draws a master switch per SECTION ("صلاحيات المستخدم",
/// "الدليل النشط") above that section's leaf permissions, and the two are
/// stored independently: a role can have the section OFF while individual
/// leaves underneath are still ON — that is exactly what the bug report's
/// screenshot shows. `MainCoreEmployeeController.isHasPermission` checks ONE of
/// them per call: pass `permission: null` and it reads the section value, pass
/// a permission and it reads only that leaf, never the section above it.
///
/// So a leaf check on its own leaves the master switch inert. [can] ANDs the
/// two, which is what makes turning a section off actually turn its actions
/// off. Call [can] (or the two typed wrappers) rather than reaching for
/// `isHasPermission` directly at a Roles call site.

  ///
  /// Purpose: Whether the role may perform [permission], honouring both the

  ///
  /// The AND is the point. A leaf left on under a section that was switched off
  /// must not grant anything: the person turning the section off means "none of
