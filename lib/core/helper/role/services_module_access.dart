/// File Name: services_module_access.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `ServicesModuleAccess` — the permission gate for the
///          Services module's five sections.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 30/8/2026
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
/// ---------------
/// Same failure as the Roles module had before [RolesModuleAccess]: the role
/// editor writes every Services permission to Firebase, and nothing in
/// `services_management_module` ever read one. Create Service, Bulk Upload,
/// Master Upload, Export, Edit, Delete, Approve/Reject, the two dashboards and
/// the request/cancel buttons were all unconditional, so toggling any of the
/// eighteen switches under `enums/services/` changed a stored value no screen
/// consulted.
///
/// THE SECTION SWITCH IS A SEPARATE VALUE
/// -------------------------------------
/// The role editor draws a master switch per SECTION above that section's leaf
/// permissions, and the two are stored independently: a role can have the
/// section OFF while individual leaves underneath are still ON.
/// `MainCoreEmployeeController.isHasPermission` checks ONE of them per call —
/// pass `permission: null` and it reads the section value, pass a permission
/// and it reads only that leaf, never the section above it.
///
/// So a leaf check on its own leaves the master switch inert. [can] ANDs the
/// two, which is what makes turning a section off actually turn its actions
/// off. Call the typed getters below (or [can]) rather than reaching for
/// `isHasPermission` directly at a Services call site.
