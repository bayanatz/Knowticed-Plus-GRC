///
/// `audio_waveforms` is **Android and iOS only** — it has no macOS, Windows or
/// Linux implementation. You can confirm that in
/// `macos/Flutter/GeneratedPluginRegistrant.swift`, where it is absent. Calling
/// [RecorderController.record] on desktop therefore throws
/// MissingPluginException, which this class caught and turned into a generic
/// Failure, which the cubit showed as "Error Occurred, Please try again". That
/// was the whole reason voice notes never worked on the desktop build — the
/// macOS microphone entitlement was necessary but not sufficient.
///
/// So: `record` (which does support macOS/Windows/Linux) does the recording on
/// desktop, and `audio_waveforms` keeps doing it on mobile, where its
/// [RecorderController] also drives the live waveform UI. Both write the same
/// kind of .m4a to the same directory, so everything downstream —
/// [AudioMessageModel], the upload, playback — is unchanged.
///
/// If voice notes break on ONE platform only, this split is the first place to
/// look.
