/// importers) and carried two extra optional fields ([requestId], [userEmail])

/// models layer where it belongs.
///
/// One *occurrence* on the calendar. The *kind* of occurrence is
/// [CalendarEventType] (see domain/enums/) — set [type] via
/// [CalendarEventModel.fromType] so the title, module and reminder offset
/// come from the spec enums instead of literals. [type] is nullable while
/// calendar_data_service is migrated module by module.

  /// Management card titled with the role name both rendered as the signed-in
  /// user's name ("Demo Company") instead.
