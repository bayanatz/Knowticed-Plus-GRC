/// Purpose: Loads the calendar's events and exposes them as state.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 12/8/2026
///
/// Added for CR-SKEL-CAL-N06 / N08. The feature had **no** `presentation/
/// controller/` at all: both pages constructed `CalendarDataService` in
/// `initState` and ran the multi-step fetch inside a `try` in the widget. The
/// two copies had also drifted — `home_calendar_page` fetched seven sources,
/// `calendar_screen` only five, so role-management and user-access events were
/// missing from the full calendar screen but present on the home card.

  /// Purpose: Fetch every event source for one user and publish them as they

  /// - [currentUserEmail]: the signed-in user. An empty value yields an empty

  /// The seven sources were already fetched concurrently, but through a bare
  /// `Future.wait`, which has two properties that produced the endless
  /// spinner:
  ///
  ///  1. **All-or-nothing timing.** Nothing was published until the *slowest*
  ///     of the seven finished, so six fast queries were held hostage by one
  ///     slow one. There is no reason for that: the calendar renders fine with
  ///     a partial set and simply gains dots as the rest land.
  ///  2. **All-or-nothing failure.** `Future.wait` rejects as soon as any one
  ///     future throws, discarding the results of the six that succeeded — the
  ///     calendar went from "loading" straight to empty-with-an-error.
  ///
  /// Each source now runs guarded and time-boxed, publishes into the state the
  /// moment it returns, and a source that fails or times out costs only its
  /// own events.
