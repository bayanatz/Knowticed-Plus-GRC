/// Module: Policy Management
/// Description: Defines [DepartmentWeight], a small value object that pairs
///              a department name with the weight (percentage) assigned to
///              it inside a single Control. Introduced so that a Control's
///              departments are no longer just names but each carry their
///              own contribution weight, with the guarantee that when all
///              departments are selected ("All") the weights are split
///              equally and always sum to 100.

/// purpose: represent a single department entry inside a Control's
///          [departments] list, together with the weight (percentage) that
///          department contributes. When a Control's departments are set to
///          equal weights (e.g. the user picked "All"), every
///          [DepartmentWeight] in the list is generated through
///          [DepartmentWeight.equalSplit] so their [weight] values always
///          sum to exactly 100.
