/// Module: GRC Control
/// Description: Shared "would-be" status computation for a Control from its
///              own effective Start Date and whether it currently has any
///              Champion/Owner assigned — the single source of truth for the
///              Unassigned/Scheduled/Active decision, reused by every place
///              a Control's status needs recomputing after an assignment
///              change (Control bulk upload, and the Champion/Owner
///              assignment pages). The single Add/Edit Control page keeps
///              its own richer, private version of this same date logic
///              (it also has to fold in Draft/manual-Inactive handling that
///              doesn't belong in a shared, assignment-only helper).
