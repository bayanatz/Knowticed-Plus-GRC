/// File Name: control_assignee_assignments.dart
/// Purpose: Contains ControlAssigneeAssignments, which tracks the user's
///          live Champion/Owner picker selections and, once the Control
///          itself has saved, diffs them against whoever was already
///          assigned and persists the difference via ChampionCubit/
///          OwnerCubit. Reports failures back to the caller instead of
///          touching the UI directly, so the page decides how to surface
///          them.
