/// ************************* FILE INFO *************************** ///
/// File Name: control_department_weight_form.dart
/// Purpose: Contains ControlDepartmentWeightForm, which owns the Department
///          multi-select selection, the Equal Weights toggle, and every
///          per-department weight TextEditingController — plus the
///          reconciliation rules for all three (checking "All", equal
///          split, add/remove a department). None of its methods call
///          setState; the page wraps each call with its own setState so
///          this class stays free of any Flutter widget/State dependency.

/// class name: [ControlDepartmentWeightForm]
///
/// purpose: - [selectedDepartments] holds every checked value from the
///            Department multi-select, including the [allDepartmentsValue]
///            sentinel when "All" is checked. [realSelectedDepartments]
///            strips that sentinel out.
///          - Checking "All" (or manually checking every real department)
///            selects every department and forces [equalWeights] on, since
///            an all-department split is always equal by definition.
///          - Otherwise [equalWeights] is user-controlled: true auto-splits
///            100 evenly across the selected departments, false requires a
///            manual weight per department (summing to 100) via
///            [departmentWeightControllers].
