/// ************************* FILE INFO *************************** ///
/// File Name: control_assignees_section_widget.dart
/// Purpose: Contains ControlAssigneesSectionWidget, the "Control Champions"
///          and "Control Owner" pickers. Edit mode only — a new Control has
///          no id to assign against yet. Each picker starts pre-selected
///          with whoever is already assigned to this exact
///          {Policy, Control} pair, filtered live by the Control's
///          currently-selected departments, and reports every toggle back
///          via its callbacks — nothing is persisted here; that happens
///          once the Control itself saves (see AddEditControlPage's
///          `_applyAssigneeChanges`).
