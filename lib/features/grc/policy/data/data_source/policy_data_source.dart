/// Module: Policy Management
/// Description: Defines the data source contract for Policy CRUD operations,
///              independent of any specific backend implementation. Controls
///              are handled by a separate [ControlDataSource] since they now
///              live in their own Firestore subcollection under each Policy.

///                                PolicyStatus.removed instead of a
///                                dedicated Is_Deleted flag, so
