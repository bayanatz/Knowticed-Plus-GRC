/// File Name: grc_table_columns.dart
/// Purpose: The column model the GRC tables share, and the rule that keeps a
///          column header on ONE line.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created At: 15/9/2026
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
/// ---------------
/// Both GRC tables (Policies, Controls) used to carry two parallel lists: a
/// `headers` list of strings and a `columnWidths` map of hand-tuned constants.
/// That has two failure modes, and both were live.
///
/// The widths were tuned to the DATA, not the header. "Control Number" and
/// "Policy Number" are wider at 14/500 than the 110.w their figures need, so
/// the header wrapped and those cells sat a line lower than the rest of the
/// header row.
///
/// And nothing tied entry N of the header list to entry N of the width map, so
/// inserting a column meant remembering to edit both — miss one and the table
/// prints a column's values under its neighbour's title.
///
/// [GrcTableColumn] pairs the two, and [resolveGrcColumnWidths] widens any
/// column whose header does not fit. Measuring beats a bigger constant because
/// the header is translated at render time: an Arabic label is a different
/// width from its English twin, and a width that fits one wraps the other.
