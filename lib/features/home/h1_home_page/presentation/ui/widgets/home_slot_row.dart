/// File Name: home_slot_row.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `HomeSlotRow` — one row of the Home Layout grid, laid out
///          in fixed slots where a card may span more than one slot.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created: 31/8/2026
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
/// ---------------
/// A row is always `HomeConstants.NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS` slots wide — the count is
/// a property of the grid, never of the cards in it. But the cards are not all
/// one slot wide: a card that needs roughly two slots must CONSUME two, and the
/// slots it does not reach must still show as empty "+" placeholders.
///
/// A plain `Row` cannot express that. Its two options are both wrong here:
///   • `Expanded` children — every card squeezed to exactly one slot, so a wide
///     card is crushed rather than given the room it needs;
///   • natural-width children — nothing stops four wide cards from totalling
///     more than the row, which is the "RIGHT OVERFLOWED BY 61 PIXELS" stripe.
///
/// So the row measures. Each card is laid out loose to learn the width it
/// actually wants, that width is converted into a whole number of slots, and
/// the next card starts after them. Once the slots are gone, the remaining
/// children are collapsed to nothing — the row can never overflow, and it never
/// needs a sideways scroll to reach a card.
