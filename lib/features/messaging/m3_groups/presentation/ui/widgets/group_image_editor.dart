/// File Name: group_image_editor.dart
/// Purpose: Group image editor — messaging Groups sub-feature.
/// Author: Knowticed Team
/// Created At: 11/10/2025
/// Updated: 2/9/2026 - now a thin wrapper over CustomImagePicker.
///
/// REWRITTEN 2/9/2026. This used to hand-roll the whole control: a CircleAvatar
/// with a ClipOval, a three-way `Image.file` / `Image.network` / placeholder
/// chain, a camera badge in a Stack, and a direct MediaPickerService call. All
/// of that is what `core/custom/46-custom_image_picker.dart` already does —
/// including the bits this copy did NOT: file-format validation, an error
/// callback, and web-safe bytes preview.
///
/// So it now just wires the group's image state to [CustomImagePicker] and
/// keeps its own job, which is telling GroupsCubit about the new file.
