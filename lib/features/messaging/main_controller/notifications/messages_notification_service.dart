/// File Name: messages_notification_service.dart
/// Purpose: The one place the messaging feature raises a notification.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 2/9/2026
///
/// ─── WHY IT EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// Before this, `lib/features/messaging` contained no reference to
/// `AppNotificationSender` at all. Messages, group invitations and polls all
/// arrived silently.
///
/// The controllers call the named methods below and pass domain values —
/// a sender name, a group name, a member id. No controller builds a
/// notification payload, picks a page key, or decides who the recipients are;
/// all of that is here, so the eleven triggers in
/// `messages_events.dart` cannot drift apart from one another.
///
/// ─── THE ID / EMAIL QUESTION ─────────────────────────────────────────
/// ⚠️ FIXED 2/9/2026. THIS FILE SHIPPED WITH A WRONG PREMISE AND SENT
/// NOTHING — read this before touching [emailForUserId].
///
/// **In this app the messaging `userId` / `memberId` IS THE EMAIL.**
/// `MessagingInterfaceImplementation.getAllUsersData` builds every connection
/// with `userId: employee.email`, and `MemberEntity.fromSingleConnectionEntity`
/// carries that straight through to `memberId`. There is no separate messaging
/// identifier anywhere in the feature.
///
/// The first version of this file assumed messaging used opaque ids and
/// resolved them by scanning `allEmployeesEntities` for `employee.id == userId`
/// — comparing a document id against an email address. That never matched, so
/// [emailForUserId] returned null for every recipient, [_send] found an empty
/// recipient set, and **every single messaging notification was dropped before
/// it was sent.** No error, no log at the sender: the module simply showed 0
/// notifications forever.
///
/// So the resolution is now: an id that looks like an email IS the address.
/// The directory scan is kept only as a fallback for a caller that genuinely
/// has a document id, and it memoises into [_emailByUserId] because a group
/// fan-out would otherwise rescan per member.
///
/// If an id cannot be resolved the send is SKIPPED, not guessed — a
/// notification delivered to the wrong person is worse than one not delivered.
///
/// ─── EVERY METHOD IS FIRE-AND-FORGET ─────────────────────────────────
/// They return `Future<void>` and swallow their own failures. A notification
/// that fails to send must never take down the message that triggered it —
/// the message is the thing the user asked for; the notification is a
/// courtesy. Call sites are free to `await` or not.
