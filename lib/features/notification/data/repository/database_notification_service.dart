/// File Name: database_notification_service.dart
/// Purpose: Notifications raised by the Database Management module.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 17/8/2026
///
/// ************************* FILE INFO ************************* ///
/// File Name: database_notification_service.dart
/// Purpose: ALL thirteen notifications the Database Management module can
///          raise — the §1.7 table of "Knowticed Plus — Notification &
///          Validation" — behind one intent-named method each.
///
/// This is the Database module's notification service. Same shape as
/// `AccountStatusNotificationService` (User Access) and the
/// `ServicesNotificationService` its header refers to: static methods, no raw
/// module / event / placeholder strings, everything delegated to
/// [AppNotificationSender].
///
/// ─── WHY THE MESSAGES ARE NOT IN THIS FILE ───────────────────────────
/// They are in `notification/domain/enums/database_module/
/// database_events.dart`, and at send time the Firestore template
/// `database_<key>` wins over the enum. So an admin editing the text in
/// Notification Control changes what these methods send, and this file never
/// needs touching for a wording change. That is the whole point of the
/// catalog; a service that formatted its own strings would put every database
/// notification outside the admin's reach, which is the bug that
/// `account_status_notification_service.dart` was rewritten to fix.
///
/// ─── WHY IT TAKES PLAIN STRINGS ──────────────────────────────────────
/// Not one parameter here is a database-feature type. The notification feature
/// must not import `DatabaseAccessGrant` / `DatabaseEntity` / `DatabaseMember`
/// — a feature raises its own notifications, so the arrow points
/// database → notification and never back. The database side of the wiring
/// (which grant changed, who was added, who was dropped, who the actor is)
/// lives in `features/database/db1_create_database/data/repository/
/// database_notification_dispatcher.dart`, which speaks both languages and is
/// the only thing that calls this class.
///
/// ─── LANGUAGE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// `isArabic` defaults to false, matching the User Access service. One call
/// sends ONE language, so a notification going to several people goes out in
/// one language; there is no per-recipient saved language preference to read
/// yet. Pass the receiver's preference at the call site once there is one.
///
/// ─── THE TWO EVENTS WITH NO CALL SITE ────────────────────────────────
/// [accessExpired] and [commentAdded] are complete and callable but nothing
/// invokes them today, deliberately:
///
///   • accessExpired is time-driven. Nothing happens in the app on the day a
///     grant's `end_date` passes — no screen is open, no write occurs — so the
///     only honest trigger is a scheduled job (Cloud Function / cron) reading
///     grants whose window just closed. Calling it from a screen would send it
///     to whoever happened to open the module that day and to nobody else. The
///     calendar covers the same date visually in the meantime; see
///     `DatabaseCalendarEvent.accessExpired`.
///   • commentAdded waits on Comments, which is unbuilt (the Figma section
///     covering it has no screens yet).
///
/// Both are kept here rather than added later so the file matches the spec
/// table one-for-one and the gap is documented instead of silent.
