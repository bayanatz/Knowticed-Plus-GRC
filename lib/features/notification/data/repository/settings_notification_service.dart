///*************************** FILE INFO ****************************///
/// File Name: settings_notification_service.dart
/// Purpose: Notifications raised by the Settings change-request flow —
///          Personal Information, Health Insurance and Emergency Contact
///          submitted / approved / rejected.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 23/8/2026
/// Updated: 24/8/2026 - `changeRequestSubmitted` now resolves its own audience
///          and fans out; Emergency Contact became a kind of its own.
///
/// ─── WHY IT EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// `settings_events.dart` has carried the change-request events since the
/// catalog was written, with bilingual titles and bodies, and the Notification
/// Control screen has been listing them for admins to edit. Nothing ever sent
/// one: there was no service between the catalog and `se6_requests`, so
/// approving or rejecting a request silently notified nobody. Same gap, same
/// shape of fix, as `UserManagementNotificationService`.
///
/// ─── AUDIENCE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// The submitted event addresses the REVIEWERS: every employee whose role
/// carries the Roles module and the `Users_Requests` permission — the same
/// three facts that decide whether the Requests button appears in
/// `user_management_home.dart`. [UserRequestsApproversRepository] answers that
/// question and falls back to the Master Admins when no role grants it, so a
/// pending request is never left with nobody to see it.
///
/// The approved and rejected events address the employee who raised the
/// request.
///
/// UPDATED 24/8/2026: `changeRequestSubmitted` used to take a single
/// `approverEmail`. No call site could supply one — nothing in the app knew who
/// the approver was — so the method had zero callers and the whole
/// submitted-to-reviewer half of the flow did not exist. The audience is now
/// resolved here rather than demanded from the caller.
///
/// ─── LANGUAGE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// `isArabic` defaults to false so call sites are explicit rather than
/// silently sending Arabic. Pass the RECEIVER's preference where you have it.
/// The reviewer fan-out sends one language to the whole batch, matching
/// `UserManagementNotificationService._toAdmins`.
