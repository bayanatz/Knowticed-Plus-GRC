/// Module: notification
///
///*************************** FILE INFO ****************************///
/// File Name: notification_deep_link.dart
/// Purpose: Turn the two strings a stored notification carries —
///          `Name_of_module` and `name_of_page` — into "which module, and
///          which SECTION of it" so tapping View lands on the screen the
///          notification is actually about.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 12/9/2026
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
/// ---------------
/// Every notification has been storing `name_of_page` since the module page
/// enums were written, and nothing has ever read it. `_handleViewNotification`
/// — copied byte-for-byte into all three inbox pages — resolved
/// `nameOfModule` to a drawer entry and stopped there, so a "your change
/// request was approved" alert and a "document pending your review" alert both
/// dropped the reader on their module's landing screen. Four of the page enums
/// say so in their own headers:
///
///     ⚠️ KNOWN GAP: the notification tap handlers … route by MODULE only.
///     They read `nameOfModule` and ignore `nameOfPage`. These keys are
///     stored correctly but not yet acted on. They are what a future
///     deep-link router will switch over.
///
/// This is that router's lookup table.
///
/// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
/// --------------------------------
/// It resolves to a SECTION, never to a record. A notification stores no
/// target id — there is no `entityId` on `NotificationModelSystem` and no
/// parameter for one on `AppNotificationSender` — so "open request #7" is not
/// answerable from a stored document, and most detail screens could not be
/// built from an id anyway: `DatabaseDetailsPage` takes a hydrated
/// `DatabaseModel`, `ViewKnowledgeDetails` takes twelve required fields, and
/// `PreviewChangesPage` takes fifteen `TextEditingController`s. So a key that
/// names a detail screen resolves to the LIST that screen is reached from —
/// the reader lands one tap away instead of nowhere near. Carrying an id is a
/// separate change: a field on the model, a parameter on the sender, and the
/// call sites in the eight module notification services.
///
/// ⚠️ RULE: a page key that matches nothing resolves to the module landing —
/// today's behaviour. This router never dead-ends a tap.
