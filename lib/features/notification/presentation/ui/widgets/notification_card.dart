///*************************** FILE INFO ****************************///
/// File Name: notification_card.dart
/// Purpose: THE notification card. Every notification list in the app renders
///          this one — the inbox, the Pinned page and the Cleared page.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 26/8/2026
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
/// ---------------
/// There were three cards: the inbox's — the design, Figma 4717:10740 — and a
/// hand-copied one on each of the Pinned and Cleared pages. The copies had
/// drifted, because every fix only ever landed on the page someone happened to
/// be looking at:
///
///   * no timestamp in the corner (the inbox grew one on 22/8/2026);
///   * 10.r body padding against the inbox's 8.r;
///   * no mobile type ramp — the sender chip kept its desktop 12/10/10 sizes
///     and its 40pt avatar at 375px;
///   * sender name / department / job title with no Flexible and no ellipsis,
///     so a long job title overflowed the chip;
///   * action buttons at the app-wide 135.sp rather than the shared width;
///   * the system-sender case handled differently again on each page.
///
/// So this file is the inbox's card, and the pages pass in the only part that
/// genuinely differs — the three action buttons:
///
///   inbox    Message  / Pin    / View
///   pinned   Message  / Unpin  / View
///   cleared  Restore  / Delete / View
///
/// Anything else that differs between the three lists is a bug in one of them,
/// not a reason to fork this widget.
