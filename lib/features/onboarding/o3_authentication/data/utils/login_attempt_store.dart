/// File Name: login_attempt_store.dart
/// Purpose: Counts consecutive failed sign-in attempts per email address and
///          decides when the account has earned a lock.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 22/8/2026
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
/// ---------------
/// The counter used to be a plain `int wrongPasswordCount` field on
/// `DemoLoginController`, which `LoginController` constructs as a field. That
/// had three problems, and together they are why an account could lock on the
/// user's second visible attempt instead of the third:
///
///  1. It was not keyed by email. Typing the wrong password once for user A and
///     once for user B left the shared counter at 2, so B's next mistake locked
///     B out on what was, for B, the first failure.
///  2. It counted *every* failed call to `login()`, including the silent
///     biometric auto-login that `LoginController.onInit()` fires on launch. A
///     stale saved credential burned an attempt before the user had typed
///     anything.
///  3. It lived only in memory, so `Get.put(LoginController())` — which
///     `SignInScreen` calls on every construction — reset it, making the
///     threshold non-deterministic in the other direction too.
///
/// The count is persisted so it survives a screen rebuild, and it is cleared on
/// every successful sign-in and whenever an admin unlocks the account.
