/// File Name: module_name_aliases.dart
/// Purpose: One canonical name per module, and every stored spelling of it.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 23/8/2026
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS
/// ---------------
/// The same module is written differently in different places, and the code
/// silently assumed one spelling per lookup:
///
///   * a role document's `Current_Selected_Modules` carries `form_builder`;
///   * `RoleCubit.moduleEnumToString(Modules.formBuilder)` emits `services_app`;
///   * `RoleRepository._getPermissionCollectionName` only answers to
///     `services_app`;
///   * the company template in `Demo_Permissions/{companyId}` is keyed
///     `form_builder`.
///
/// THE BUG THIS FIXES
/// ------------------
/// A role listing `form_builder` could not be saved. Its permissions loaded
/// into `modulePermissions['form_builder']` — filled from the company template,
/// so every one of them `true` — while every switch the user could see wrote to
/// `modulePermissions['services_app']`, a different bucket. `form_builder` was
/// not in `RoleCubit.availableModules`, so no admin template was ever loaded
/// under that key, and `isPermissionAllowedByAdmin` denies an unknown module by
/// default. `updateRole` then reported all fifteen permissions as "restricted
/// by administrator" — and turning every visible switch off could not clear it,
/// because none of those switches touched that bucket.
///
/// Normalising the name at every boundary collapses the buckets into one.
///
/// ADDING A MODULE: put the alias here, not in a `case` somewhere. Every lookup
/// keyed by module name should go through [canonical] first.
abstract final class ModuleNameAliases {
  const ModuleNameAliases._();

  /// Stored spelling → the name the code uses for that module.

  /// that is what the permission collections and the switch pages key on.
