/// File Name: dialog.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `RoleDialogs`.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Updated: 12/8/2026 - Rebuilt "save for later" on top of CustomDialogManager
///          (core/custom/dialogs) and fixed the post-save navigation so the
///          roles home lands on a loaded list instead of a stuck spinner.
/// Updated: 25/8/2026 - Added `showSaveRoleDialog`: the create / save flow from
///          SettingsSwitchesPage, which used to navigate straight out of the
///          confirm dialog and never showed a success dialog at all.

  /// ADDED 25/8/2026. SettingsSwitchesPage used to call `ConfirmDialog` and do
  /// the work inside `onConfirm`, which popped three or four page routes the
  /// instant the write returned. That had two faults:
  ///
  ///   * NO SUCCESS DIALOG. Every other write in the app confirms itself; this
  ///     one dropped the user back on the roles home with nothing to say the
  ///     role had been created — and nothing to say it had NOT been, either.
  ///   * IT POPPED ON FAILURE TOO. `addNewRole` / `updateRole` report a problem
  ///     by emitting [RoleError] rather than throwing, and that state was never
  ///     read, so a permission violation or a Firestore error navigated away
  ///     exactly like a success and the user's work looked saved.
  ///
  /// The flow is now the shared [CustomDialogManager.showDialogFlow]: confirm →
  /// run → success dialog → and only then navigate, from `onSuccessComplete`,
  /// which fires after the success dialog has closed. A failure shows the error
  /// and stays on the page so the user can fix it and press save again.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  ///   - pagesToPop: how many pages to leave once the role is saved. Defaults
  ///     to the wizard's own depth: 3 while creating (settings → permissions →
  ///     adding-new-role) and 4 while editing, which also clears role details.
