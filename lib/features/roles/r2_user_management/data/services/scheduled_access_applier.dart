/// File Name: scheduled_access_applier.dart
/// Purpose: Detects pre-dated access changes whose start date has arrived and
///          raises the two "Scheduled Access Applied" notifications for them.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 26/8/2026
///
/// ─── WHY IT EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// Spec §1.5 defines eight notifications. Seven of them fire from
/// `UserManagementAccessRepository`. The eighth is a PAIR —
/// `scheduledAccessAppliedUser` and `scheduledAccessAppliedAdmin`, both sent
/// by one call to
/// `UserManagementNotificationService.sendScheduledAccessAppliedNotification`
/// — and it was the only §1.5 row with no trigger, because its trigger is
/// "the job that executes pre-dated access changes" and no such job existed.
/// That is why the module sat at 6 of 8 rather than 7 of 8: one uncalled
/// method costs two spec rows.
///
/// ─── WHY THIS IS A DETECTOR AND NOT A MUTATOR ────────────────────────
/// "Executes the change" is misleading about how this app stores permissions.
/// `updateUserPermission` writes the role to `Employees_Info.Role` and the
/// window to `User_Management.From_Date` in the SAME transaction — the role is
/// already on the account the moment an admin saves it. `From_Date` is not a
/// deferred write waiting to be flushed; it is the date from which
/// `getUserAccessStatus` stops reporting `scheduled` and starts reporting
/// `active`.
///
/// So there is nothing to apply. What there is, is a moment that passes
/// unobserved: the clock crosses `From_Date` and the user's access silently
/// becomes live. This service is what observes it. Writing a mutator instead
/// would mean re-applying a role the document already holds, which is a no-op
/// dressed up as a job.
///
/// ─── RUNNING ONCE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// Announcing the same date twice is worse than not announcing it, so every
/// send is sealed by writing the announced date back to the permission
/// document as [_appliedForField]. The seal is the DATE STRING, not a boolean:
/// if an admin later re-schedules the same user to a new future date, the seal
/// no longer matches and that new date earns its own announcement.
///
/// The write is a merge (`RoleRemoteDataSource.updateRoleWithinTransaction`
/// and every other writer to this collection use `SetOptions(merge: true)`),
/// so the field survives later permission saves and costs nothing to carry.
///
/// ─── NOT ANNOUNCING HISTORY ──────────────────────────────────────────
/// The seal did not exist before today, so on the first run every pre-dated
/// change ever made looks unannounced. Sending all of them would put years of
/// "your access change has been applied" in every inbox at once. Anything
/// older than [_announceWindowDays] is therefore sealed SILENTLY — recorded as
/// handled, never sent. Only changes that landed inside the window are real
/// news.
///
/// ─── WHERE IT RUNS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// [applyDue] is called from `UserManagementAccessRepository
/// .getUsersPermissionsData()`, i.e. whenever the User Management screen
/// loads. That is the right place for a client-side detector: it is the one
/// moment an administrator is present, it scans every user rather than only
/// the signed-in one, and the collection read it needs is small.
///
/// ⚠️ The consequence, stated plainly: an affected user hears about their own
/// applied change only once SOMEBODY opens User Management. In a tenant with
/// active administrators that is daily; in one without, it may not happen. The
/// fix is a scheduled backend job, and this class is shaped for it — it takes
/// both its Firestore handle and its clock as parameters and holds no widget,
/// cubit or locator reference, so only [applyDue]'s caller would change.
