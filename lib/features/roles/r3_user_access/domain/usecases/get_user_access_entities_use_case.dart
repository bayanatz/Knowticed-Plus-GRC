  /// Function Name: [_bucketFor]
  ///
  /// Purpose: The one chip an account is counted under.
  ///
  /// FIXED 25/8/2026 — "the card in the تفعيل مجدول chip has no Edit Schedule,
  /// and it is painted green".
  ///
  /// The old rule bucketed on the DATE alone:
  ///
  ///     if (willBeActivated) -> willBeActivated            // status ignored
  ///     else if (willBeDeactivated) -> willBeDeactivated
  ///     else -> status
  ///
  /// while `UserAccessCard` decides what a card IS from the status and the date
  /// together (`_displayStatus` / `_hasSchedule`: locked first, then
  /// `!isActive && willBeActivated`, then `isActive && willBeDeactivated`).
  ///
  /// The two disagreed for an ACTIVE account still carrying an old
  /// `reactivationDate`: the chip counted it as Scheduled Activation, while the
  /// card read it as plain active — so it painted green and offered
  /// `[Edit, Deactivate]` with no Edit Schedule. Same for a LOCKED account with
  /// a leftover date, which the chip pulled out of the Locked bucket even
  /// though its card shows the locked ribbon and only offers Unlock.
  ///
  /// This now mirrors `UserAccessCard._displayStatus` exactly, so a chip and
  /// the cards inside it can no longer disagree. A stale date on an account
  /// whose status has moved on is ignored, which is also what the Figma implies
  /// (MESBAH / ROLE MANAGEMENT, User Access MAIN PAGE): Scheduled Activation is
  /// a state an INACTIVE account is in — its menu is
  /// `Edit / Edit Schedule / Cancel Activate`, while a deactivated account with
  /// no schedule gets `Edit / Active`, and an active one `Edit / Deactivate`.
  ///
  /// KEEP THE TWO IN STEP: if `_displayStatus` changes, change this with it.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [entity]: the account to place.
  ///
  /// Returns: [EmployeeStatusEnum] the single chip it belongs under.

  /// Function Name: [_displayableCategory]

  /// Purpose: Map a stored status onto one the status row actually renders.

  /// ADDED 13/8/2026. `AccountStatusConstants.employeeStatus` — the chip list —
  /// renders six of the nine [EmployeeStatusEnum] values; `inactive`,
  /// `lockedWithRequest` and `resetPassword` are commented out there. Every
  /// entity was still bucketed under its raw status, so anyone holding one of
  /// those three counted towards `all` and towards no visible chip. The chips
  /// therefore could not sum to the total — the reported "how 88 and 8, the
  /// total is 98": the two missing accounts sit in a hidden bucket.
  ///
  /// Folding them into the nearest rendered equivalent keeps every account
  /// visible and makes the arithmetic hold, without inventing new chips (which
  /// is a design decision, not a bug fix). If you would rather surface these as
  /// their own chips — `lockedWithRequest` in particular is actionable, since
  /// somebody is waiting on an unlock — uncomment them in
  /// `AccountStatusConstants` and delete this method.
