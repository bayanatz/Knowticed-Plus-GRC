/// Flattened, read-only view of [AcademicHistory] (academic_model.dart).
///
/// [AcademicHistory] stores the full audit trail — every field is a
/// `List<String?>` plus `timestamps`. This entity holds only the *current*
/// value of each field (i.e. `.lastOrNull` of each list), which is what the
/// UI and the services module consume. The two are intentionally different
/// shapes, not duplicates: keep this projection for scalar reads and use
/// [AcademicHistory] whenever the history itself matters.
///
/// Lives next to academic_model.dart so the pairing is obvious.
///
/// NOTE: a second class with this exact name and these exact 8 fields also
/// exists at services_management_module/main_controller/data/models/
/// model_employee.dart. That copy is the fully-featured one (it has
/// `fromJson`/`toJson` and Firestore key constants) and serves the services
/// module; this copy's `toJson()` is an empty stub and is never called. The two
/// are unrelated by import, so consolidating them would couple
/// active_directory to services_management_module — worth doing deliberately
/// rather than as a drive-by.
