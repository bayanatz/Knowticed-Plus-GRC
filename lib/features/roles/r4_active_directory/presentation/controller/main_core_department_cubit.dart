  /// ✅ FIX 31/8/2026 (bug report p13, "why it doesn't accept the

  /// is not built that way. `_getDepartmentMapsFromDepartmentsList` stores the
  /// English key as `departmentName.toLowerCase()`, so a caller passing
  /// "Information Technology" — the department's real, capitalised name, and
  /// what a user naturally types in the bulk-upload sheet — matched nothing and
  /// got null back. The bulk-upload validator reports that null as "department
  /// does not exist", so a correctly spelled sheet was flagged row by row and
  /// could not be uploaded at all; only an all-lowercase "information
  /// technology" was accepted.
  ///
  /// The exact key is tried first, then the lower-cased one:
  ///   * the exact match keeps the ARABIC entries working — those are stored
  ///     verbatim rather than lower-cased (Arabic has no case, so lowering is
  ///     a no-op there either way);
  ///   * the fallback is what accepts any capitalisation of an English name.
  ///
  /// Trimmed as well: a name arriving from a spreadsheet cell routinely carries
  /// a trailing space.
  ///

  /// lower-cases at its own call site — evidence this normalisation belonged
  /// in here all along, where every caller gets it, rather than in each caller
  /// that happens to remember.
