/// FILE NAME: custom_table_body.dart
/// PURPOSE: this file contains the custom table body.
/// Author: Amr Mesbah
/// Created At: 2/2/2025
/// Updated: 30/8/2026 - Now the read-mode half of `UserText`
///          (r4_active_directory/.../user_data_widgets/text_widget.dart),
///          so a system logs cell and an Active Directory cell are the same
///          cell. Three things changed and all three were what made the two
///          tables look different:
///            * the fixed `width: 0.2.w / 0.17.w` is gone — it forced every
///              column to one fifth of the screen regardless of content,
///              which is why the logs table had huge columns and needed a
///              hand-guessed scroll width. `DataTable` measures columns now.
///            * the text style is `StyleText.fontSize16Weight600`
///              instead of `AppFontStyle.cairoRegularStyle` at a
///              fraction-of-screen size.
///            * alignment is `centerStart`, not centred, and an empty value
///              renders as `-` rather than a blank cell.
///          Height is pinned to 38.h to match `UserText`, which pins it so a
///          row never changes height; `DefaultDataTable` clamps the row to
///          46.h either way.
/// Updated: 30/8/2026 - Values are centred under their heading and set at
///          12.sp (headings are 14.sp), replacing start-aligned 16.sp text.
