/// File Name: employee_directory_model.dart
/// Purpose: One row of the employee directory collection.
/// Author: MohamedFouad
/// Created at: January/7/2024
/// Updated: 11/8/2026 - CR-SKEL-SEMAIN-N21: fields are final, the Firestore
///          keys are `static const`, `copyWith` added, `Department` moved to
///          its own file, and the instance method `fromJson` — which returned
///          a raw `Map` instead of a model — replaced with a real factory.
///
/// Ported into services_app under features/settings (source: services_app
/// features/employees/data/models/employee_model/employee_directory_model.dart).
