/// File Name: settings_controller.dart

///          employee, the directory entry and the per-section controllers.
/// Author: Amr Mesbah
/// Created at: 10/11/2024
/// Updated: 11/8/2026 - Converted GetxController -> Cubit; the two silent
///          empty catches now emit SettingsError; repository injected; the
///          employee/employeeDirectory globals moved here.
///
/// The class name and the `Get.put` / `Get.find` registration are kept: the
/// rest of the app resolves this through GetX. Only the state mechanism
/// changed, matching how NavBarCubit and AppDrawerCubit were converted.
