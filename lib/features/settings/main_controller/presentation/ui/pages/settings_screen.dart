/// Resolves the single [SettingsController], registering it on first use.
///
/// FIXED 18/8/2026: this was `_settingsOrNull`, which returned `null` whenever
/// the controller was not yet registered with GetX. That made the `employee`
/// SETTER below a silent no-op: `LoginController.initData` assigns
/// `employee = ...` twice (after `getEmployee`, and on the login-success
/// branch) and both writes were dropped, because `SettingsController` is not
/// created until something calls `Get.put` on it — the run log shows it being
/// created only AFTER `AppDrawerCubit`, i.e. after login had already written.
///
/// The reads then returned `null` for the rest of the session, which is where
/// two crashes came from:
///   * `login_controller.dart` — `employee!.lastLogin = ...`
///     ("Null check operator used on a null value", uncaught async).
///   * `70-custom_appbar.dart` — `employee!.title` while building the
///     AppBar's BlocBuilder.
///
/// Registering lazily makes the store exist before the first write, so the
/// value written at login is the value read afterwards. `SettingsController()`
/// takes no required arguments and does no I/O in its constructor (`init()` is
/// a separate, explicitly-called step), so constructing it here is cheap and
/// has no side effects.

/// cubit. Prefer `Get.find<SettingsController>().employee` in new code.
