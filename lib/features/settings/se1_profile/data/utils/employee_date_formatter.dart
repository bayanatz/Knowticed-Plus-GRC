/// File Name: employee_date_formatter.dart
/// Purpose: Parse and format the birthday value stored on an employee.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 11/8/2026
///
/// Added for CR-SKEL-SE1-N12 / N13. `formatDate` used to live on a
/// StatelessWidget in presentation/ui/ with a `try/catch` inside it (forbidden,
/// §11.2) and a `print()` in the catch. `DateFormat.parseStrict` is the only
/// call here that throws, so the exception handling belongs to this layer and
/// the widgets just call [parse] / [format].

  /// - [date]: the value to render.
  /// - [localeName]: an intl locale name, e.g. `ar` or `en`. Arabic locales get
  ///   Arabic-Indic digits from `intl` itself — the hand-rolled `ArabicDigits`
  ///   string replacement it replaces was flagged as reinventing intl
  ///   (CR-SKEL-SE1-N13).
  ///
  /// Returns: [String].
  ///
  /// CHANGED 8/9/2026 — display is now [displayPattern] ("23 Aug 2023"), not
  /// [storagePattern]. The two were the same string, which is why the personal
  /// information page showed a birthday as `1977/11/12`: an all-numeric date
  /// whose field order a reader has to guess. Storage is unaffected — see
  /// [toStorage] — and [parse] already accepted `dd MMM yyyy` on the way back
  /// in, so nothing that was written before needs migrating.
  ///
  /// The month name follows the locale, so Arabic renders as `٢٣ أغسطس ٢٠٢٣`.
  /// That is safe here: main() runs `AppBarDate.ensureDateFormattingInitialized()`
  /// at start-up, which loads intl date symbols for every supported locale.
  /// Only the language subtag is passed on — a full tag such as `ar-EG` has no
  /// symbol data of its own and would rely on intl's fallback.
  ///
  /// [LocalizedDigits] still runs afterwards; where intl has already produced
  /// Arabic-Indic digits it finds no ASCII digits left and returns the string
  /// unchanged.
