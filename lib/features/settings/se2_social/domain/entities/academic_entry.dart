/// File Name: academic_entry.dart
/// Purpose: One academic-history record on an employee's social profile.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 11/8/2026
///
/// Added for CR-SKEL-SE2-N02. The feature had no domain layer: an academic
/// record existed only as a `Map<String, TextEditingController>` on the
/// controller, so "what is a record" was defined by four string keys typed out
/// in five different places.
