/// Added for CR-SKEL-SE6-N11. `'${getBaseUrl('Modules')}/roles'` was assembled
/// at six call sites across four files, and `getBaseUrl('Employees_Info')` at
/// three more. One of those call sites had drifted: the submit page used to
/// build `{baseUri}/Modules/roles/Employees/{id}` for the employee document, a
/// collection that does not exist, which is where "Employee document not found"
/// came from.
