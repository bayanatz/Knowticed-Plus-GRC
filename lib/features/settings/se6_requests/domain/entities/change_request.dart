/// File Name: change_request.dart
/// Purpose: One submitted change request — every field edited in one session,
///          plus who submitted it and where it stands.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 11/8/2026
///
/// Added for CR-SKEL-SE6-N03. A request existed only as a
/// `Map<String, dynamic>` assembled by hand in `preview_changes_page.dart` and
/// re-parsed by hand in `request_page.dart` and `details_request.dart` — three
/// copies of the same 12 string keys, which is how the older single-field shape
/// (`whatChanged` / `oldValue` / `newValue`) and the newer `changes` array came
/// to be read differently in different screens.
