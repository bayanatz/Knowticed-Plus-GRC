/// File Name: request_controller.dart
/// Purpose: Read-only request lookups still used by the login bootstrap.
/// Author: Amr Mesbah
/// Created at: 13/11/2024
/// Updated: 11/8/2026 - CR-SKEL-SE6-N09/N14: the four write methods are
///          deleted. All four were unreachable and all four were broken:
///
///          * `createRequest` reported `RxStatus.success()` unconditionally, so
///            a failed write still looked like a success.
///          * `updateRequest` chained `.then(...)` with no `catchError`, so a
///            failure silently skipped the employee-profile update.
///          * `acceptAll` built a `WriteBatch`, never added anything to it,
///            awaited each `set()` individually in the loop, then committed the
///            empty batch — which always succeeds. The atomicity was decorative.
///          * `updateEmployeeProfile` had its entire body commented out, so a
///            request could be marked approved with nothing written to the
///            employee record.
///
///          The working replacements live in `RequestsRepository` /
///          `RequestsCubit`, which is what the pages now use.
///
/// REMAINING GetX (CR-SKEL-SE6-N04): the two read methods below are still
/// GetX-shaped because `login_controller.dart:954` calls `getAllRequests` during
/// the login bootstrap. Converting them means touching onboarding, which is
/// outside this feature's scope — the migration is staged, not finished.
