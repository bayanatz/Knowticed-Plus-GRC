/// File Name: request_section_label.dart
/// Purpose: Render a request's stored `section` as localized display text.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 13/8/2026
///
/// Added while fixing the untranslated "Personal Information" / "Health
/// Insurance" chips on the request cards.
///
/// `ChangeRequest.section` is stored as free English text in Firestore
/// (`ChangeRequest.defaultSection` is the literal `'Personal Information'`),
/// so it can never be shown raw. Two pages had their own private
/// `_translateTitle` for this and they had drifted: `details_request.dart`
/// handled Personal Information, Emergency Contact and Health Insurance, while
/// `request_page.dart` — the list the user actually looks at — was missing the
/// Personal Information case entirely, which is why that one chip stayed in
/// English next to a correctly translated التأمين الصحي.
///
/// Both copies also hardcoded the Arabic strings inline rather than using the
/// `personalInformation` / `healthInsurance` / `emergencyContact` keys that
/// already existed in both .arb files.

  /// exact spelling, but nothing enforces it, and a document holding
  /// `personal_information`, `Personal information` or a double space fell
  /// straight through to `default` and rendered in English with no error
  /// anywhere. Casing, underscores and repeated spaces are now all folded away,
  /// so only a genuinely unknown section falls back.
