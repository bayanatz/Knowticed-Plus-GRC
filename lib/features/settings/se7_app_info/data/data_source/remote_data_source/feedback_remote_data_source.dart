/// File Name: feedback_remote_data_source.dart
/// Purpose: The Firestore reads and writes behind the comments-and-feedback
///          screen.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 13/8/2026
/// Updated: 2/9/2026 - `submit` also writes the `details` object behind the
///          "More Options" panel (module, screen, design/logic issue, device,
///          software, frequency, steps to reproduce).
/// Updated: 1/9/2026 - `submit` now writes a LIST of attachments and the
///          submitter's priority, and [listForEmployee] gives the "Request
///          Details" list whole documents instead of the three integers
///          [countsByStatus] returns.
///
/// Added while fixing the dead submit button — there was no data layer for
/// this feature at all, in any module. The screen collected three text bodies
/// and then dropped them on the floor.

  ///     appear at the BOTTOM of a list that claims to be newest-first. Sorting
