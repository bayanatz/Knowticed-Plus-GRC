/// File Name: app_feedback.dart
/// Purpose: One feedback submission from the comments-and-feedback screen,
///          plus the read model the "Request Details" list renders.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 13/8/2026
/// Updated: 1/9/2026 - Figma "Comments and Feedbacks" (MESBAH, nodes
///          7628:7681 and 7628:8180). Three additions:
///            • MANY attachments per box, not one. The screen now shows the
///              uploaded files in a grid with an "Attach Document" button at
///              the end, so `bugAttachment` and its two siblings became
///              `List<FeedbackAttachment>` keyed by kind.
///            • A [FeedbackPriority] per box — the Priority dropdown the
///              design puts under each text area.
///            • [FeedbackRequest], the READ model. This feature was
///              write-only apart from `countsByStatus`; the request list needs
///              whole documents, not just three integers.
///
/// Added while fixing the dead submit button. The screen offers three
/// independent boxes — report a bug, improvements to an existing feature,
/// request a feature — and the user may fill any combination of them, so one
/// submission carries up to three bodies rather than a single message plus a
/// type.
///
/// Updated: 2/9/2026 - Figma's "More Options" panel. Each box now also carries
/// a [FeedbackDetails] — module, screen, design/logic issue, device, software,
/// frequency and steps to reproduce. Kept in `feedback_details.dart` rather
/// than here: those seven enums describe a report's CONTENT, the three in this
/// file describe its LIFECYCLE, and folding them together would double the
/// length of this one.

import 'package:grc_module/features/settings/se7_app_info/domain/entities/feedback_details.dart';

/// Re-exported deliberately. [AppFeedback] now has a [FeedbackDetails] on it,
/// so every file that already imports this one — the screen, the cubit, the
/// data source, the request card — would otherwise need a second import added
/// on the same line of work. One import keeps naming the whole feedback model.

/// [open] so every submission already in Firestore counts correctly without a
/// migration.
