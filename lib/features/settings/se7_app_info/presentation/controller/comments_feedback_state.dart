/// How the "Request Details" list is ordered.
///
/// Date Requested, in both directions — that is the whole menu.
///
/// NARROWED 1/9/2026. It also offered Status and Type. Both were dropped: the
/// status chips sit directly above the list and the type IS each card's title,
/// so those two sorts reordered the list by something already on screen while
/// taking the only ordering that carries information off the top.
///
/// [descending] is the default because the list is a person's own submissions
/// and the thing they just sent is the thing they came to look at.
///
/// NOTE 2/9/2026 — "the default" and "what the user picked" are now different
/// things. `CommentsFeedbackLoaded.sortOption` is NULLABLE: null means nobody
/// has opened the sort menu yet, and the list is still ordered [descending]
/// because that is the default. The Sort button reads that null to draw itself
/// dimmed, so do not collapse the two by defaulting the field — see
/// [CommentsFeedbackLoaded.sortOption] and `FeedbackSortMenu`.

/// two are deliberately different types rather than a nullable status that
/// every call site would have to null-check.
