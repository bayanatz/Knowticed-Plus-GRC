/// File Name: feedback_priority_dropdown.dart
/// Purpose: The "Select Priority" field under each box on the comments and
///          feedback form.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 1/9/2026
/// Updated: 1/9/2026 - Rebuilt on [CustomDropdown]. It was a hand-rolled
///          PopupMenuButton, which meant a second idea about placeholder
///          colour, label size and chevron in a codebase that already has one.
///
/// Figma: MESBAH 7628:8169 — a 265×36 field with a chevron, sitting beside the
/// "Attach Document" button.
///
/// The label, the 14.sp-label / 12.sp-hint type scale and the placeholder
/// colour all come from [CustomDropdown]; nothing is restated here. Only two
/// things are passed that are specific to this screen: the [AppColors.card]
/// fill and the 36 height the design draws.
///
/// NOTE the clear path. [CustomDropdown.onChanged] is `ValueChanged<T>`, so it
/// can only ever report a CHOSEN value — there is no "none" entry, and none is
/// wanted: priority is optional, the field starts empty, and the way to clear
/// it is to untick the box, which drops the whole entry in the screen's
/// `_priorities` map.
