/// ADDED 31/8/2026. The Figma "Watermark Style" card opens with a

/// not be built at all. `WatermarkPainter` reads this to decide whether to
/// paint a rounded background behind each stamp.

/// The modules the "Watermark Modules" grid offers, in Figma's reading order.
///
/// ADDED 31/8/2026. Drawn from [Modules] rather than restated here, so the
/// icons (`Modules.iconPath`) and names (`Modules.getModuleName`) come from
/// `modules_enum.dart` — a rename or a new icon there flows straight through to
/// this screen with no edit in the settings feature.
///
/// NOT every [Modules] value. `database`, `requests`, `notification`,
/// `employees` and `more` are absent: Figma does not draw them.
///
/// CHANGED 2/9/2026 — `home` and `settings` were on that excluded list too, on
/// the reasoning that the stamp on the settings shell is what lets an admin see
/// their own edits take effect, so letting them switch it off there would be a
/// trap. That call has been overridden: the master Active switch is gone, and
/// this grid is now the ONLY on/off control the feature has — so it has to be
/// able to reach every surface the watermark actually covers, Home and the
/// settings shell included. The preview pane still shows the stamp regardless
/// of what these two tiles say, so the "cannot see my own edit" trap does not
/// bite.
///
/// Home is first because it is the surface an admin thinks of first; Settings
/// is last because it is the least likely to be touched.
///
/// KNOWN GAP: Figma also draws a "Risk Register" tile. There is no
/// `Modules.riskRegister` to back it, so it is omitted rather than invented.
/// Adding that enum value is the fix; this list then picks it up.
