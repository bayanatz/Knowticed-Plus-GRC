/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 25/8/2026
///
/// Holds TWO copies of the settings: [WatermarkState.saved] (what is stored)
/// and [WatermarkState.draft] (what the sliders are showing). Everything the
/// screen needs follows from the pair — the preview renders the draft, "Save"
/// is enabled only while they differ, and "Discard Changes" is just
/// `draft = saved`. Editing the stored copy in place would leave nothing to
/// discard back to.
