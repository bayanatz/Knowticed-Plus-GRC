/// File Name: watermark_layer.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `WatermarkLayer` — stamps the saved watermark over any
///          page, as a layer on top of it.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 25/8/2026
///
/// This is the piece that makes the feature real. `WatermarkScreen` only
/// CONFIGURES the stamp; [WatermarkLayer] is what actually puts it over the
/// app, so a screenshot of any wrapped page carries the viewer's identity.
///
/// WHERE IT IS APPLIED
/// -------------------
/// Choke points, chosen because everything downstream of them is covered for
/// free — not page by page:
///   * `get_pages.dart` — all eleven pushed `Routes.settingsX` destinations go
///     through one `.map(...)`, so wrapping there covers the lot.
///   * `settings_layout.dart` — the settings shell, which covers the list and
///     every embedded right-hand panel on desktop and tablet.
///   * `home_responsive_page.dart` — the ONE widget `Modules.home` builds, on
///     every form factor. ADDED 25/8/2026.
///   * `role_screen.dart` (`RoleScreenHost`) — the ONE widget `Modules.roles`
///     builds. It hosts the module's nested Navigator, so wrapping ABOVE that
///     Navigator also stamps every page pushed inside the module (AddingNewRole,
///     RoleDetailsPage, the user-management detail pages, …). ADDED 25/8/2026.
///   * `adding_widget_page.dart` and `preview_page.dart` — home pages that are
///     pushed onto an outer navigator on the phone branch and so sit OUTSIDE
///     HomeResponsivePage's subtree. ADDED 25/8/2026.
/// Adding a settings or roles page later needs no change here: a new route
/// joins that map, a new panel sits inside the shell, a new roles page is
/// pushed into the module navigator — all already covered.
///
/// NESTING IS SAFE
/// ---------------
/// A [WatermarkLayer] inside another one hands its child straight back — see
/// [_WatermarkScope]. That is what makes the belt-and-braces wrapping above
/// correct rather than reckless: `AddingWidgetPage` is wrapped for the phone
/// path, and on tablet it is ALSO a descendant of the wrapped
/// `HomeResponsivePage` — without the guard that page would be stamped twice,
/// at double opacity and with the two grids fighting each other.
///
/// IT SHOWS THE SAVED SETTINGS, NOT THE DRAFT
/// ------------------------------------------
/// Deliberate. While an admin drags the sliders on the Watermark screen, the
/// stamp around them stays at the last saved value instead of thrashing — the
/// live preview of the draft is the preview pane's job, and having the whole
/// screen restyle under a moving thumb is disorienting.

/// darker stamp and the two staggered grids interleave into the unreadable
/// smear this feature already had to be fixed once for. With it, the OUTERMOST
/// layer wins and every inner one is a no-op — which means a call site never

/// editor is not an ancestor the editor can reach past — it is
/// `custom_drawer.dart`'s wrap around the WHOLE shell body, mounted long before

/// is a DESCENDANT of the thing painting over it, and a descendant cannot
/// un-paint an ancestor's overlay. So the signal has to travel upwards, and a
/// listenable outside the tree is the only thing that does that.

/// transition (the outgoing editor is still mounted while the incoming one
/// initialises), and a bool would be cleared by the first one to dispose.

/// whatever the last save said while the admin was busy choosing something
/// else, competing with the live draft in the preview pane beside it.
///
/// USE THIS SPARINGLY. It suppresses the stamp app-wide for as long as it is
/// mounted, which is a security control switched off — it is right for the one
/// screen whose whole job is configuring that control, and almost certainly

  // Settings bug report p.4: "when press on watermark it load and open
  // personal information". This layer used to return the bare `child` when it
  // was not stamping, and `WatermarkPreview(child: _WatermarkScope(child:
  // child))` when it was. Those are different widget trees, so every switch
  // between them made Flutter throw away and REBUILD the entire subtree below.
  // The outermost layer wraps the whole app shell (custom_drawer.dart), and
  // opening the Watermark editor mounts a [NoWatermark], which turns every
  // layer off — so the shell, the Settings screen and the navigator the editor
  // had just been pushed onto were all rebuilt from scratch: a spinner, then
  // Settings on its default pane (Personal Information), editor gone. Saving
  // a watermark, or toggling a module, did the same.
  //
  // Now the tree is always `_WatermarkScope > Stack[child, stamp?]`. `child`
  // is always the Stack's first child at the same depth, so it keeps its state
  // whether the stamp is drawn, hidden or suppressed; only the painter after
  // it comes and goes.
