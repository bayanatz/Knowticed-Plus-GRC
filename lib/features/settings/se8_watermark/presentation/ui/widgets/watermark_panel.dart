/// File Name: watermark_panel.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `WatermarkPanel` — the "Watermark Content",
///          "Watermark Modules" and "Watermark Style" cards.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 25/8/2026
/// Updated: 31/8/2026 - Rebuilt against the Figma frame. Three things the
///          previous build was missing or getting wrong:
///
///          1. THE "WATERMARK MODULES" CARD DID NOT EXIST. Figma draws a grid
///             of module tiles between Content and Style; there was no card
///             here and no field behind it on the entity. The grid is built
///             from `kWatermarkModules` so icons and names come from
///             `modules_enum.dart` rather than being restated in this feature.
///
///          2. THE "STYLE" ROW DID NOT EXIST. Figma opens the Style card with a
///             Text / Bubble radio pair. Added, backed by the new
///             `WatermarkSettings.styleMode`.
///
///          3. NO TEXT ELLIPSISES ANY MORE. The field chips were fixed-width
///             `Expanded` cells with `TextOverflow.ellipsis`, so they rendered
///             "Employee E…", "Employee Ph…", "Employee Na…" — three labels the
///             reader cannot tell apart, which is the entire job of a segmented
///             control. Chips now size to their own text and wrap; slider
///             labels wrap instead of truncating. There is no
///             `TextOverflow.ellipsis` left in this file, deliberately: every
///             string here is a control label, and a truncated control label is
///             a broken control.
///
/// Source: Figma BuJXLizpGcK5eHVBqQomXc, ROLE MANAGEMENT > "Settings Home Page"
/// (node 4717:8596). Cards: radius 8, padding 15, 10 between them.
///
/// TYPOGRAPHY: every `Text` here goes through
/// `StyleText.<token>.copyWith(fontSize: ...)` — never a bare `TextStyle` — so
/// family and weight track the app theme and only the size is local. The sizes
/// themselves live in `_Type` below rather than scattered through the file.
///
/// ICONS: `assets/icons_assets/watermark/`. The checkbox and chevron there are
/// byte-for-byte copies of the app's own `checkbox_checked_yellow`,
/// `checkbox_empty_outline` and `chevron_down` — the same glyphs the design
/// draws. Module tile icons come from `Modules.iconPath`.

/// The modules from [kWatermarkModules] this account is actually allowed to

/// ADDED 2/9/2026. The grid used to draw all fifteen tiles regardless of who
/// was looking, so an admin whose role does not include CRM or Inventory was
/// still asked to decide whether those modules carry a watermark — modules they
/// cannot open, and whose tiles do not exist in their drawer.
///
/// The gate is the SAME list the drawer rail is built from,
/// [AppDrawerCubit.allowedDrawerModules] (see `drawer_menu_item.dart` and
/// `custom_drawer.dart`), so this grid can never disagree with the rail beside
/// it: that list is already the role gate AND the company-license gate applied
/// together, and re-deriving either one here would drift the moment the drawer's
/// rules change.
///
/// `Get.find`, not `context.read`: neither cubit is provided in the widget tree
/// — both are registered through GetX — the same reason `DrawerMenuItem` takes
/// its cubit as a constructor argument.
///
/// FALLBACK IS "SHOW EVERYTHING", deliberately. If neither shell controller is
/// registered yet, or the one that is is still resolving the employee's role
/// (`isLoadingModules`), an empty intersection would render an empty card that
/// reads as broken. Showing the full list in that window is the safer failure:
/// it can only offer a choice that has no effect, never hide one the admin
/// needs.
///
/// NOTE: this filters what is DRAWN, not what is stored. A module already in
/// `settings.modules` keeps its stamp even when it is hidden here — an admin
/// who cannot see CRM must not silently un-stamp it for the whole company.

/// drew every module regardless of role. `HomeResponsivePage._handleSizeChange`
/// DELETES `AppDrawerCubit` when the layout goes mobile and registers
/// [NavBarCubit] in its place, so on a phone the very first line —
/// `Get.isRegistered<AppDrawerCubit>()` — was always false and the function
/// returned the full list before looking at anything.
///
/// Both cubits derive their list the same way (role gate AND company licence
/// applied together), so reading whichever one exists keeps this grid in step
/// with the navigation the user actually has, on either layout, without this
/// feature re-deriving either rule for itself.
///
/// On mobile that list is the union of the bottom-bar tabs and the More page:
/// `navBarModules` holds only the handful that fit in the bar, and everything
/// else the role allows is in `moreListModules`. Either alone would hide
/// modules the user can genuinely open.
