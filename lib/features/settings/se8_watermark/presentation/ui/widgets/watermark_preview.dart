/// File Name: watermark_preview.dart
/// Purpose: Declares `WatermarkPainter` and `WatermarkPreview` — the tiled
///          diagonal stamp, both for the Settings preview pane and for use as
///          a real overlay over app content.
/// Author: Knowticed Plus team
/// Created at: 25/8/2026
///
/// Source: Figma BuJXLizpGcK5eHVBqQomXc, node 7524:14443 (the preview pane on
/// the Watermark settings screen).
///
/// Deliberately NOT preview-only. The Settings screen shows the stamp over a
/// blank card, but the same painter is what should sit over real content later
/// — so it takes a [WatermarkSettings] and a sample string and knows nothing
/// about Settings. Wrap any widget with [WatermarkPreview] to stamp it.
